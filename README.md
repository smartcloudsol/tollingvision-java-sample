# üöó Java Sample Application for Tolling Vision

This repository contains a sample Java application that demonstrates how to use [Tolling Vision](https://tollingvision.com) ‚Äî a Dockerized AI-powered service for tolling companies. Tolling Vision extracts valuable information from vehicle images or image sequences, including:

- **ANPR/ALPR** ‚Äì Automatic Number Plate Recognition  
- **MMR** ‚Äì Make and Model Recognition  
- **ADR** ‚Äì Dangerous Goods Sign Recognition

Tolling Vision is highly scalable and easily integrates into existing systems via **gRPC**. For step-by-step integration, see our [How to use Tolling Vision](https://tollingvision.com/how-to-use-tolling-vision/) guide.

This sample application demonstrates the use of the `analyze` function in the `TollingVisionService`, which is designed for complex analysis scenarios. It processes multiple images per vehicle ‚Äî such as **front**, **rear**, and **overview** shots ‚Äî to extract license plate data and MMR details.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure the following are installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+**
- **Maven** (build tool)
- **Tolling Vision service** (running locally or remotely ‚Äî see [Get Started](https://tollingvision.com/get-started))

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. üì¶ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartcloudsol/tollingvision-java-sample.git
cd tollingvision-java-sample
```

### 2. üõ†Ô∏è Build the Project

Use Maven to compile the project:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Sample

Run the application with the following command, replacing the placeholders as needed:

```bash
java -cp target:target/* com.smartcloudsolutions.tollingvision.TollingVisionSample <ADDRESS> <SECURED> <THREAD_COUNT> <IMAGE_FOLDER> <RESULT_FILE> <GROUP_PATTERN> <FRONT_PATTERN> <REAR_PATTERN> <OVERVIEW_PATTERN>
```

## üß© Parameter Descriptions

| Parameter         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `<ADDRESS>`       | IP and port of the Tolling Vision service, in `ip:port` format. |
| `<SECURED>`       | `true` or `false` ‚Äî whether SSL/TLS encryption is used. |
| `<THREAD_COUNT>`  | Number of parallel requests (max allowed by your license). |
| `<IMAGE_FOLDER>`  | Path to the folder containing images to analyze. |
| `<RESULT_FILE>`   | File path where results will be saved (CSV format). |
| `<GROUP_PATTERN>` | Regex to group images for analysis (e.g., `"^.{7}"` groups by the first 7 characters). The first match group is used as the group key. |
| `<FRONT_PATTERN>` | Regex to detect front images within a group (e.g., `".*front.*"`). |
| `<REAR_PATTERN>`  | Regex to detect rear images within a group (e.g., `".*rear.*"`). |
| `<OVERVIEW_PATTERN>` | Regex to detect overview images (e.g., `".*scene.*"`). |

## üìö Example Usage

```bash
java -cp target:target/* com.smartcloudsolutions.tollingvision.TollingVisionSample 192.168.1.100:443 true 4 ./images ./output/results.csv "^.{7}" ".*front.*" ".*rear.*" ".*scene.*"
